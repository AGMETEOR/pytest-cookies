# pytest-cookies

[pytest][pytest] is a mature testing framework for Python that is developed
by a thriving and ever-growing community of volunteers. It uses plain assert
statements and regular Python comparisons. At the core of the pytest test
framework is a powerful hook-based plugin system.

**pytest-cookies** is a pytest plugin that comes with a ``cookies`` fixture
*which is a
wrapper for the [cookiecutter][cookiecutter] API for generating projects. It
helps you verify that your template is working as expected and takes care of
cleaning up after running the tests. üç™
